# 🔬 Signature Drift in Cancer Cells

This beginner-level bioinformatics project analyzes how gene expression "drifts" in cancerous vs. normal lung cells using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and t-tests.

## 🧪 Tools Used
- Google Colab
- Python
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, scipy

## 📁 Files
- `Signature_Drift_Cancer_Cells.ipynb` — the main analysis notebook
- `lung_cancer.csv` — sample dataset

## 📊 What It Does
- Performs PCA to reduce gene expression features
- Visualizes class separation in PCA space
- Computes a drift score (distance from origin)
- Runs t-tests to compare cancer vs. normal groups

## 🚀 Try It Yourself
Open the notebook in Google Colab and upload the dataset:
